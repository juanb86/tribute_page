          He was born on July 14, 1923 in La Plata. The son of a carpenter and
          dressmaker, he lived a poor childhood in El Mondongo, an immigrant
          neighborhood. After graduating in 1949, he practiced as a rural doctor
          in Jacinto Aráuz, La Pampa, for twelve years. Married to María
          Antonia, his high school girlfriend. In January 1962, he entered the
          Cleveland Clinic, in the United States, where he remained until June
          1971. There he developed myocardial revascularization surgery, or the
          bypass technique, which made his prestige transcend the limits of that
          country. Favaloro made 13,000 by-passes until his 69 years, when he
          decided to dedicate himself entirely to teaching. He returned in 1971,
          with the idea of ​​developing a center that combined medical care,
          research and education. With this objective, the Favaloro Foundation
          was created in 1975. In 1980, he founded the Basic Research Laboratory
          that depended on the Favaloro Foundation's Research and Teaching
          Department. Subsequently, it became the Basic Sciences Research
          Institute of the University Institute of Biomedical Sciences, which,
          in turn, led in August 1998 to the creation of the Favaloro
          University. In 1992, the Favaloro Foundation Institute of Cardiology
          and Cardiovascular Surgery was inaugurated in Buenos Aires. He was an
          active member of 24 societies, corresponding to 4, and honorary of 42.
          He received countless international distinctions among which stand
          out: the 1979 John Scott Prize, awarded by the city of Philadelphia,
          USA; the creation of the "Dr René G. Favaloro" Chair of Cardiovascular
          Surgery (Tel Aviv University, Israel, 1980); the distinction of the
          Fundación Conchita Rábago de Giménez Díaz (Madrid, Spain, 1982); the
          Argentine Master of Medicine award (1986); the Distinguished Alumnus
          Award from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (1987); The Gairdner
          Foundation International Award, awarded by the Gairdner Foundation
          (Toronto, Canada, 1987); the René Leriche Prize 1989, awarded by the
          International Society of Surgery; the Gifted Teacher Award, awarded by
          the American College of Cardiology (1992); the Golden Plate Award from
          the American Academy of Achievement (1993); the Prince Mahidol Prize,
          awarded by His Majesty the King of Thailand (Bangkok, Thailand, 1999).
          He killed himself on Saturday, July 29, 2000 at his home in the city
          of Buenos Aires by shooting himself in the heart. The tragic decision
          would have been the outbreak of a serious depression caused by the
          economic and financial difficulties faced by the Foundation that he
          presided over, aggravated by the lack of sensitivity and responses on
          the part of various medical entities, both public and private, that
          maintained unpaid debts due to the sum of 18 million dollars with your
          institution.
